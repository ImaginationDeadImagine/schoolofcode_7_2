              Fred Sanger was an English biochemist who developed techniques for determining the sequences of three fundamental biological molecules, namely proteins, RNA and DNA.

          <ul>
              <li><strong>1918</strong>  Born into a Quaker household in Gloucestershire, England</li>
              <li><strong>1927</strong>  Age nine, sent to a Quaker-run residential preparatory school near Malvern</li>
              <li><strong>1932</strong>  Age 14, sent to the Bryanston School in Dorset.  He enjoyed scientific subjects and completed his School Certificate a year early.  This allowed him to spend his final year carrying out laboratory experiments in chemistry.</li>
              <li><strong>1936</strong>  Attended St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences.  Whilst at Cambridge he met his future wife, Joan Howe.</li>
              <li><strong>1940</strong>  Graduated from Cambridge and married Joan.  In the same year he began studying for a PhD.</li>
              <li><strong>1943</strong>  Awarded his doctorate for a thesis on "The metabolism of the amino acid lysine in the animal body."</li>

          <h3>Sequencing Insulin</h3>
          <p>In 1943 Sanger joined a group in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge that was working on the structure of bovine insulin.  This protein was chosen partly because it was readily available in pure form from the local Boots chemist.</p>
          <p>Sanger used various chemical and enzymatic methods to break down the two polypeptide chains of the insulin molecule into smaller fragments.  He identified the amino acids present in the smaller fragments and was able to piece together the amino acid sequence of each of the two chains.</p>
          <p>The work was finally completed in 1955 with the determination of the position of three cross-links between cysteine residues, two interchain and one intrachain.</p>
          <p>Sanger had worked patiently for twelve years and was rewarded with the first complete amino acid sequence for a protein.  This demonstrated that insulin had a definite structure and suggested that this was the case for all proteins.  For this work Sanger received his first Nobel prize in 1958.</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.000245">When an experiment is a complete failure it is best not to spend too much time worrying about it but rather get on with planning and becoming involved in the next one. This is always exciting and you soon forget your troubles.</blockquote>
          <h3>Sequencing RNA</h3>
          <p>Whilst continuing to work on refinements of the techniques he had used in sequencing insulin Sanger became interested in ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and whether it might be possible to determine their structure by sequencing methods.  He generated ribonucleotide fragments of various RNA molecules using a variety of nucleases.</p>
          <p>In the race to sequence the first RNA molecule he was beaten into second place by a group from Cornell University that published the 77 ribonucleotide sequence of a yeast alanine transfer RNA (tRNA) in 1965, but in 1967 had determined the 120 nucleotide sequence of the 5S ribosomal RNA of the bacterium <em>E.coli</em>.</p>
          <h3>Sequencing DNA</h3>
          <p>Sanger next turned his attention to sequencing DNA, the material of the genes first postulated by Gregor Mendel as the basis of inheritance.</p>
          <p>He tried a number of approaches using <em>E.coli</em> DNA polymerase to copy single stranded DNA using radiolabelled nucleotides which allowed the products to be visualised after separation in polyacrylamide gels.  By 1977 he and his colleagues had determined most of the sequence of a single-stranded bacterial virus, bacteriophage &phi;X174, some 5,300 nucleotides.</p>
          <p>Sanger introduced a new technique, now known as the Sanger method, with which he and colleagues determined the sequence of human mitochondrial DNA, some 16,500 base pairs, in 1981.  The following year the DNA sequence of bacteriophage &lambda; was published by Sanger and his co-workers, consisting of 48,502 base pairs.</p>
          <p>The work on DNA sequencing earned Sanger his second Nobel prize in 1980.  He is one of only four people to have ever won two Nobel prizes, and the only person to have done so in chemistry.</p>

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>Sanger retired at the height of his powers in 1983 and, for much of the rest of his life, enjoyed working on his garden.  He received many honours but remained a humble man.  He turned down a British knighthood because he did not want to be called 'Sir', which he felt would set him apart from other people.</p>
          <p>In 1992 the Sanger Centre was founded and named after him.  Now known as the Sanger Institute, it was heavily involved in the Human Genome Project (HGP).</p>
          <p>The Sanger method went on to be used as the basic technology in the HGP, where the 23 human chromosomes, consisting of approximately 3 billion base pairs, were sequenced.  The initial draft of the sequence was published in 2001.</p>
          <p>Fred Sanger died in Cambridge in 2013.  His obituary noted that he had described himself as "just a chap who messed about in his lab" which sums up his talent for self-effacement.</p>
